  summary: Agent based model for flood incidents

  description: >
    FIRM is an agent-based model that simulates how people and organisations respond to the effects
    of flood infrastructure failure before, during, and after extreme weather events. The model can
    be used to assess different strategies to minimise threats to lives and infrastructure during a
    flood incident.
