## Built With

Java JDK 17

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any platform with a Java Runtime Engine (JRE) suitable to run JDK 17 compiled Java code

### Installation

The program does not need installation as such. It is packaged as a .jar file which can be copied to
a directory and executed from there. The program needs configuration for where to find data files..

### Running Locally

The program is packaged in a .jar file and can be run either from the command line or
for Windowzy people by double-clicking on the jar file (as long as the JRE) is
installed on the system. If a JRE is required, find the download and installation instructions
online.
### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

The application is intended for dockerisation to run on DAFNI. However, it doesn't have to be. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
